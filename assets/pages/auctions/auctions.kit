                                    The key to Kusama’s scalable multichain architecture, parachains connect to the network by leasing a slot on the Relay Chain via permissionless auction. As Polkadot’s canary network, Kusama will roll out parachain auctions first for testing and optimization. Parachains will likely be onboarded to Kusama gradually at first to make sure everything is running smoothly, but no promises.

                                                        If you are participating in a Kusama-native crowdloan (see FAQ below), never send your KSM to an address. Native crowdloan contributions are made with a special transaction in Kusama using what’s called a campaign index, where contributed KSM remain locked until the end of the lease period. Legitimate teams will not ask you to send KSM to an address to participate in a Kusama-native crowdloan.

                                                        If participating in a non-native crowdloan campaign, always consult the official channels of parachain teams to verify the details of how to participate. Remember that scammers may try to impersonate official channels and team members. Never participate in a crowdloan you don’t trust, and never send tokens to someone you don’t trust.

However, it will take some time before Kusama fully supports 100 parachain slots, and they are likely to be added to the system slowly over time. Not all of these slots will be allocated via parachain slot auctions (upon successful governance vote to begin auctions), as some will be used for governance-enabled <a href="https://polkadot.network/common-good-parachains-an-introduction-to-governance-allocated-parachain-slots/" target="_blank">common-good parachains</a> and parathreads.

At the conclusion of the slot lease period, anyone can request for the full amount of KSM to be unlocked, after which it is once again free to be used for activities such as transfers, withdrawals, and staking. For crowdloans, contributed KSM is locked from the moment the contribution is made until the end of the lease period, unless the crowdloan campaign is unsuccessful in securing a slot via auction, in which case contributed KSM can be unlocked at the end of the campaign as specified by the parachain team. All contributions must be returned before the crowdloan is fully deleted from the system.

However, it's important to realize that the actual cost of a parachain slot is not the same as the size of the parachain bid. Since parachain bonds are returned at the conclusion of the slot lease, the actual cost of running a parachain is best characterized as the opportunity cost of not staking those KSM for the duration of the lease period. The need to run <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-collator#docsNav" target="_blank">collators</a> is an additional but relatively minor cost. In general, for high throughput applications we expect parachains to be more economical than building with smart contracts or building a standalone blockchain.

In the case of crowdloan campaigns, a campaign can be set up to last for several auctions to increase the chances of winning a slot. If a team does not win a slot by the end of their set crowdloan campaign endpoint, the total amount of contributed KSM can be once again unlocked and the team will need to initiate a new campaign if they wish to continue participating in auctions.

Common-good chains are parachains viewed as a common-good, in the sense that they will benefit the entire network, for example a bridge that apps on Kusama could use to connect to an external network like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Chains are designated as a common-good parachain by network governance, which can vote to allocate the chain an empty slot on the Relay Chain, thereby bypassing the auction process. Common-good chains can be thought of as system-level and public utility chains that provide functions and benefits to the network that builders can tap into.

To participate in a crowdloan, users agree to lock up a portion of KSM for the duration of the parachain slot lease period, after which they can be unlocked. To participate in a crowdloan, you must have a transferable balance of KSM, so if your tokens are currently locked due to staking, you’ll need to unbond them in advance of the crowdloan campaign. The unbonding period on Kusama is currently 7 days. The details of individual crowdloan campaigns and the process for joining them will be determined and communicated by the respective parachain teams. <strong>Important: Kusama’s native crowdloan mechanism does NOT require users to send KSM from their own wallet/account to a third-party address to participate in a crowdloan. Native crowdloan contributions are made with a special transaction using what’s called a campaign index, whereby contributed KSM remain locked in the campaign index (if the auction is successful, contributed KSM remains locked from the moment the contribution is made until the end of the lease period). Legitimate teams conducting a crowdloan natively on Kusama will NOT ask you to send tokens to their address to participate. However, some teams may choose to conduct a crowdloan campaign using other mechanisms or platforms. In this case, be sure to never send tokens to anyone you don’t trust. Always check teams’ official channels to find out how to participate.</strong>

A project team who is sourcing the required KSM from its community may choose the type of award, if any, offered to participants for locking their KSM in the event of a winning bid. The decision on the type of award to offer for a successfully secured parachain slot is completely in the control of the project teams and will not receive any input from Web3 Foundation. Awards will take many forms and may vary widely among projects, from a network’s native token to certain goods or rights as directed by project teams and accepted by community members.
